# 4.2 Lab Bird Homepage

This is a simple webpage with some text and a few images, set up according to the lab assignment.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. There is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project. Please run the live preview,
then copy the link and put it in your browser. Last, shrink you browser window to ~half 
your screen to match the width requirement of this assignment.
